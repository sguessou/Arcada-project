Description:

This is the project I've been working on for the PHP course I attended last year at the Arcada University. It's an 
ecommerce site, coded using a framework we built from scratch during the course. It was fun I learned a ton of things
related to OOP in PHP, and also the MVC design pattern in web projects.
